  "markup": "<p data-start=\"385\" data-end=\"692\">All employees are paid on a biweekly basis, with paydays occurring every other Friday. If a regular payday falls on a holiday, pay will be issued on the preceding business day. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed through the end of the previous payroll period.</p>\n<p data-start=\"694\" data-end=\"978\">Employees may choose to receive their pay via direct deposit or physical check. Direct deposit is the preferred method, and we encourage all team members to enroll. Changes to direct deposit information must be submitted at least five business days prior to the next scheduled payday.</p>\n<p data-start=\"980\" data-end=\"1257\">If you notice an error in your paycheck, contact Payroll immediately. We will investigate and resolve any discrepancies as quickly as possible, typically within one pay cycle. Unauthorized deductions are prohibited unless required by law or approved in writing by the employee.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1259\" data-end=\"1443\">Your pay stub will include detailed information about earnings, taxes withheld, and other deductions. You may access current and past pay stubs through the Employee Portal at any time.</p>",
